# sf-lwc-docs-diff

A small script that scrapes the Salesforce Lightning Web Component documentation and specs from the [Salesforce developer component reference](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/overview/components) site so that we can diff previous versions of the components and therefore track updates that are not always publicing announced.
